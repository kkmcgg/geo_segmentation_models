# geo_segmentation_models
This is a placeholder for a fork of segmentation_models that adds geo/rasterio functionality 

## Segmentation Models
A beautiful and classic library for accessing pretrained unet and linknet models for keras

https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models

## rasterio
A relatively beautiful library for slicing and dicing georaster images 

https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio

## torchGeo
A decent looking newer faster stronger alternative to this. Testing may prove this moot. 
Seems windows friendly and uses conda

## raster-vision
Another alternative. Looks nice but does not support windows.
