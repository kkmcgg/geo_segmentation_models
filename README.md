# geo_segmentation_models
This is a placeholder for a fork of segmentation_models that adds geo/rasterio functionality 
basic idea is to chop things up as required to run through a vgg unet or similar and then put it all back together. 
simple setup begun in scripts. 

## Segmentation Models
A beautiful and classic library for accessing pretrained unet and linknet models for keras

## rasterio
A relatively beautiful library for slicing and dicing georaster images

## torchGeo
A decent looking newer faster stronger alternative to this. Testing may prove this moot. 
Seems windows friendly and uses conda

## raster-vision
Another alternative. Looks nice but does not support windows.
